# EPA-mapping

Mapping EPA monitor data for BNE.

## Contents

* [EPA\_monitor\_data](EPA_monitor_data) is a directory that contains two EPA monitor data .csv files. The [README.txt](EPA_monitor_data/README.txt) file in the directory has more detailed information. 
* [cb\_2016\_us\_state\_500k](cb_2016_us_state_500k) is a directory containing all of the necessary shape files for mapping the US including state borders.
* [output\_maps](output_maps) is a directory containing two sample output maps as .png files. 
* [monitor\_maps.Rmd](monitor_maps.Rmd) contains the source code used to make the maps in [output\_maps](output_maps). It should be easy to run within RStudio. The documentation should be decent.
* [other-maps.Rmd](other-maps.Rmd) contains source code to make more complicated maps but *it cannot be run as I have not uploaded the necessary files it needs*. I've included it just incase the code is useful for other projects. It is not well documented at all.
